# Deploy Lamp Stack on Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team wants to deploy a PHP website on a Kubernetes cluster. They plan to use Apache as the web server and MySQL for the database. The team has already gathered the requirements and now wants to make the website live. More details can be found below:



1) Create a ConfigMap named php-config containing the data variables_order = "EGPCS" for the php.ini file.

2) Create a Deployment named lamp-wp.

3) Within this Deployment, create two containers. The first container should be named httpd-php-container and utilize the image webdevops/php-apache:alpine-3-php7. The second container should be named mysql-container and use the image mysql:5.6. Mount the php-config ConfigMap in the httpd container at the location /opt/docker/etc/php/php.ini.

4) Note that secrets have already been created for the following MySQL-related values: MySQL root password, MySQL user, MySQL password, MySQL host, and MySQL database. These secrets are securely stored and can be accessed as needed.

5) Add the following environment variables for both containers: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, and MYSQL_HOST. Ensure that their values are sourced from the secrets created earlier. Please utilize the env field (do not use envFrom) to define the name-value pairs of the environment variables.

6) Create a NodePort type Service named lamp-service to expose the web application, specifying the NodePort as 30008.

7) Create a Service for MySQL named mysql-service, ensuring its port is set to 3306.

8) A file named /tmp/index.php is available on the jump-host.

a) Copy this file into the httpd container under the Apache document root at /app, replacing the dummy values for MySQL-related variables with the corresponding environment variables you have defined. Ensure that the MySQL-related details are not hardcoded in this file, and utilize environment variables to retrieve those values.

b) You should be able to access the index.php file through NodePort 30008. Upon accessing this page, the message Connected successfully should be displayed.
